# JARVIS AI ASSISTANT In PYTHON
Hello guys you can use it modify for your own facilitys.

**How i made it ?**
I know this is weird , but by mixing a bunch of libraries like gTTS(google text to speech) and speechRecognition to talk and listen to you 
then the webbrowser and the wikipedia library to integrate search and stuff like that !

*Next Version*
I will Add arduino functionalities to it , like when i say open the door it gives the order to the arduino
to move the motor ...
And i will link it to a LLM like Gemini or Gpt4 , to understand most of my speech and give accurate responses.
